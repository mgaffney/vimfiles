A TAGS BROWSER

Since CTRL-] takes you to the definition of the identifier under the cursor,
you can use a list of identifier names as a table of contents.  Here is an
example.
   First create a list of identifiers (this requires Exuberant ctags): >

	ctags --c-types=f -f functions *.c

Now start Vim without a file, and edit this file in Vim, in a vertically split
window: >

	vim
	:vsplit functions

The window contains a list of all the functions.  There is some more stuff,
but you can ignore that.  Do ":setlocal ts=99" to clean it up a bit.
   In this window, define a mapping: >

	:nnoremap <buffer> <CR> 0ye<C-W>w:tag <C-R>"<CR>

Move the cursor to the line that contains the function you want to go to.
Now press <Enter>.  Vim will go to the other window and jump to the selected
function.
