1. Delete the relevant section from the .gitmodules file.  The section would look similar to:
	[submodule "vendor"]	
	path = vendor	
	url = git://github.com/some-user/some-repo.git

2. Stage the .gitmodules changes via command line using: git add .gitmodules
3. Delete the relevant section from .git/config, which will look like:
	[submodule "vendor"]
	url = git://github.com/some-user/some-repo.git

4. Run git rm --cached path/to/submodule .  Don't include a trailing slash -- that will lead to an error.
5. Run rm -rf .git/modules/submodule_name
6. Commit the change
7. Delete the now untracked submodule files rm -rf path/to/submodule
